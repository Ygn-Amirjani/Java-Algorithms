# Stack In Java

Stack works on the principle of LIFO (Last In First Out), it means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item to be removed. Or the first item added to the stack will be the last item to be removed.Here are three of the most important stack functions :

## 1. Push (new_element)

Add the new element at the top of the stack ! In fact, the new element is written above the previous element, and as a result, when leaving, first this element and then the previous element are deleted. 

## 2. Pop ()

The last added element is removed each time the call is made .

## 3. peek ()

Return the last element added .
